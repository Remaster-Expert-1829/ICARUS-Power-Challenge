Mostly qwen was used for this project, the entire chat can be accessed using this link: https://chat.qwen.ai/s/dcdc56b9-9614-4dad-9f15-1e8bbc6872cb?fev=0.0.203

Now coming to the instructions generated by qwen, I will be totally honest but even after asking qwen so many times on how to implement a PWL current source I couldn't get it to work because it kept giving me completely wrong ways to implement it so I had to use a pulse voltage source of 24.494898V(approximately gives 6W power input) with a duty cycle of 66.6667%(approximately equivalent to 60 mins active in a 90 mins cycle) which works mostly like the PWL current source. The SOC proxy and timed loads approach were kinda changed as well and switch with pulse voltage was used for the timed loads.

One of the sources that helped me the most was this reddit thread for suggesting the pulse voltage https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/s33dxv/is_there_a_way_to_rapidly_produce_such_a_signal/
