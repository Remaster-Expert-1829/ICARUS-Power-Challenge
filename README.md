# ICARUS-Power-Challenge
a repo for icarus' phase 2

---------------------

Tools used:
qwen ai- for understanding the project and making sense of the steps
circuitjs1- online open source SPICE tool for creating the circuit and obtaining waveforms

Approach & Assumptions:
Instead of a PWL current source a pulse voltage was used since I wasn't able to make PWL source work, I did read about using a current source with a VCCS to make it work, in the official documentation(https://www.falstad.com/circuit/doc/)
